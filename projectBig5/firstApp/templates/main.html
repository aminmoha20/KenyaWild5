    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        The Big Five are Kenya’s most iconic wildlife species, celebrated for their strength, beauty, 
        and cultural significance. Our project showcases their importance in conservation and tourism.
    </p>
    <p>
        Historically, the term "Big Five" was coined by hunters to describe the five most difficult animals 
        to hunt on foot: lion, leopard, elephant, rhino, and buffalo. Today, the phrase has been reclaimed 
        to highlight their role in wildlife conservation and eco-tourism, symbolizing Kenya’s natural heritage.
    </p>
    <p>
        These animals are not only central to Kenya’s biodiversity but also to its economy, as they attract 
        millions of visitors each year. Safaris across national parks and reserves provide opportunities 
        to witness the Big Five in their natural habitats, fostering appreciation and support for conservation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Protecting the Big Five is critical in the fight against poaching, habitat loss, and climate change. 
        Through education, awareness, and sustainable tourism, our project aims to inspire communities and 
        visitors alike to value and safeguard these magnificent creatures for generations to come.
